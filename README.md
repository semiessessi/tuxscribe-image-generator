tuxscribe-image-generator
=========================

A tool for making png images for tuxscribe or wikihiero-image-generator


Known Issues
------------

The console output doesn't appear. There isn't a convenient way to have a console application use System.Windows.Forms. It is possible to hack around this in unhelpful ways but I have not yet found a decent solution to this.
